GPUE requires Cuda 4.0 minimum, and runs as expected up to 6.0 on both Linux and Mac OS X (Nvidia GPU only), Python 2.6+, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Mencoder
No testing on higher versions has been performed yet.

To build, first check the predefined paths in the Makefile (CUDA lib/lib64, bin, include, etc).

Configuring the simulation parameters is as easy as editing the bin/run_params.conf file, and entering them as specified. 
Each new line will represent another simulation, with the maximum number of simultaneous simulations to be given as specified in run.sh.

To run the simulations:
chmod +x ./run.sh; ./run.sh

If the image generation fails, this can be rectified manually by editing the files py/vis.py, and selecting the appropriate operation.
