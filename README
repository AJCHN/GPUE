Runs as expected up on CUDA 7.0 on both Linux and Mac OS X (Nvidia GPU only), but also works with 5.0. Other requirements are Python 2.6+, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Mencoder.
C++11 functionality will be added soon, requiring a minimum of CUDA 7.0. 

To build, first check the predefined paths in the Makefile (CUDA lib/lib64, bin, include, etc).

Configuring the simulation parameters is as easy as editing the bin/run_params.conf file, and entering them as specified. 
Each new line will represent another simulation, with the maximum number of simultaneous simulations to be given in run.sh.

To run the simulations:
chmod +x ./run.sh; ./run.sh

If the image generation fails, this can be rectified manually by editing the file py/vis.py, and selecting the appropriate operation.
Not all Python code may currently not behave as expected, due to the switch over to vortex tracking entirely in C++.
